//  Which elevation route an operation takes, and — more importantly — which

//  The helper and the osascript path both end in an administrator prompt and
//  both run the same trusted engine, so falling back is safe. What would not
//  be safe is the reverse: quietly widening what the helper accepts, or
//  routing to a root daemon whose build no longer matches the app driving it.
//  Every guard below is one of those.
//
//  Pure decisions, no daemon, no registration, no XPC.
