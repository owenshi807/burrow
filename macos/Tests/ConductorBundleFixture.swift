//  ConductorBundleFixture.swift
//  BurrowTests
//
//  Lets a test say which build it is exercising — one that bundled the `burrow` conductor, or
//  one that didn't — instead of inheriting whichever the test host happened to stage.
//
//  Resources/burrow is produced by the "Bundle burrow-engine (MIT)" phase, which is gated on a
//  populated vendor/burrow-engine checkout. CI never fetches submodules, so it always tested the
//  absent case; a developer who checked the submodule out (required for Network, Orphans and
//  Photos to do anything) always tested the present case and saw unrelated failures.
