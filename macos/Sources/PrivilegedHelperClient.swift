//
//  PrivilegedHelperClient.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  The GUI's side of the privileged helper: registration, connection, and one
//  typed operation at a time.
//
//  ── What this replaces, and what it does not ────────────────────────────
//  The existing elevation path builds a shell string and hands it to
//  `osascript … with administrator privileges` (see `MoleCLI.elevatedScript`).
//  That path is password-only by construction — the `system.privilege.admin`
//  right authenticates through SecurityAgent's classic mechanism, which never
//  offers Touch ID — and it cannot be cancelled safely, because killing
//  osascript orphans the root child it spawned.
//
//  The helper fixes both, but it can only be used once the user has approved
//  registering a launch daemon, which is its own one-time macOS prompt. Until
//  then — and if the user declines it outright — the osascript path remains,
//  unchanged, as the fallback. `PrivilegeRoute` is where that choice is made,
//  and it is a pure function so the conditions are visible and tested rather
//  than scattered through call sites.
//
//  ── The security properties this file must not weaken ──────────────────
//  * Every root operation authenticates freshly. The client never caches an
//    authorization, never reuses an operation ID, and never pre-authorizes.
//  * The client cannot describe a command. It picks a `HelperOperation`, and
//    the daemon derives argv from the enum.
//  * A helper whose build doesn't match this app is not used at all.
