//
//  BurrowConductor.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  Runs the bundled `burrow` binary (Resources/burrow, from bundle-burrow.sh — the new
//  `caezium/burrow-engine` Rust crate; see that script's header for the naming story) and returns
//  parsed envelopes. One JSON envelope per command, NDJSON streaming for progress — so the GUI
//  parses ONE shape instead of each call site re-implementing "spawn the engine → parse its
//  output".
//
//  Resolution: the engine is entirely self-contained (it looks for nothing else — no sibling
//  digger directory, unlike the old conductor this file used to front). Spawning reuses the
//  tested capture stack (MoEngine + MoleProcess) via a `.executable(path)` target — no new
//  process plumbing. When it isn't bundled (dev/CI builds without the vendor/burrow-engine
//  submodule) `isAvailable` is false and callers fall back to the direct engine resolution in
//  `MoleCLI`.
//
//  mo/engine argv are NOT the same wire format: `mo` runs a command LIVE by default and
//  `--dry-run` previews it; the engine inverts that (dry-run by default, `--apply` to execute).
//  `engineArgv(fromMo:)` is the one pure mapping between them, shared by every caller that still
//  speaks mo-style argv (`MoActions`'s catalog, and this file's own streaming path) — see its doc
//  for why a run reaching the engine with the wrong half of this translation is destructive in one
//  direction and merely silent in the other.
