//
//  MoInteractive.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  Drives Mole's INTERACTIVE selection TUIs (`mo installer`, `mo purge`)
//  from the GUI so the user can pick WHICH items to remove — and Mole
//  itself does the deletion. Mole exposes no flags/JSON for targeted
//  removal; its only selection is the on-screen checklist. So Burrow runs
//  `mo` in a pseudo-terminal, parses that checklist into a native list,
//  and replays the user's choices as keystrokes (↓ / Space / Enter).
//
//  The pure parts here — parsing a screen and planning keystrokes — are
//  unit-tested. The PTY plumbing (PTYTask / MoInteractiveRunner) is the
//  thin impure seam. Crucially, after sending the toggles we RE-READ the
//  screen and verify the selection matches before pressing Enter, so a
//  parsing/cursor bug can never make Mole delete the wrong thing.
