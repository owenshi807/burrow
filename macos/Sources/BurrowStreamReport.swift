//  BurrowStreamReport.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  Reduces the NDJSON progress feed from `burrow-engine clean --stream` / `optimize --stream`
//  into the (groups, summary) shape TaskReportView renders — the same TaskRunReport the old
//  human-text `parseTaskReport` produced, so the Clean/Optimize views + completion notification
//  are unchanged. The engine emits one JSON object per line:
//
//    clean live:    {"event":"removed","path":P,"bytes":N} | {"event":"failed",...} |
//                   {"event":"protected",...}  then  {"event":"done","freed_bytes":N,
//                   "freed_human":H,"removed":N,"failed":N,"protected":N}
//    clean preview: {"event":"would_remove","path":P,"bytes":N}  then  {"event":"done",
//                   "dry_run":true,"would_free_bytes":N,"would_free_human":H,"count":N}
//    optimize live: {"event":"task","name":T,"ok":B,"error":E|null}  then  {"event":"done",
//                   "ok":B,"tasks":N,"failed":N}
//    optimize prev: {"event":"would_run","name":T,"description":D}  then  {"event":"done",
//                   "dry_run":true,"tasks":N}
//
//  Parsed line-by-line with JSONSerialization (like BurrowEnvelope) — the reduce is called on the
//  accumulated `[String]` after every streamed line (throttled) and once at exit. Output that
//  isn't NDJSON at all (a legacy Homebrew `mo`, reachable when no conductor is bundled) falls
//  through to `parseTaskReport` rather than reducing to a blank report — see `reduce`.
