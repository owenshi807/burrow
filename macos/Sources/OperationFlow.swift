//
//  OperationFlow.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  The run-a-tool lifecycle, owned once: Full Disk Access gate → optional
//  elevation → spawn → stream → reduce → report → OperationCenter
//  begin/detail/end → done/failed/cancelled. Operation views shrink to
//  layout + localized copy; per-tool variation is DATA in a ToolOperation
//  descriptor (args, stdin, gate, elevation, a pure reduce closure) —
//  never a subclass.
//
//  The process boundary is one method behind ProcessPort. Production takes its
//  streaming port from the MoEngine facade (MoEngine.shared.streamPort, the real
//  SystemProcessPort) so "how do I run mo?" has one answer; tests still script a
//  fake by injecting `process:` directly. SystemProcessPort streams long-running
//  ops (Clean/Optimize); MoleProcess (the #29 capture-spawn runner) captures
//  one-shot output — both now hang off MoEngine, coexisting by use-case.
