//
//  HelperContract.swift
//  Burrow / BurrowHelper (shared)
//
//  The wire contract between the GUI and the root helper. Compiled into BOTH
//  targets so the two can never disagree about what a request means.
//
//  Everything in this file is pure Foundation — no SwiftUI, no Sparkle, no
//  Sentry — because the helper is a bare launchd daemon that must stay small,
//  auditable, and free of anything that could pull UI or network code into a
//  root process.
//
//  ── Why the contract looks like this ────────────────────────────────────
//  The old elevation path handed osascript a SHELL STRING built from an
//  executable path plus argv (`MoleCLI.elevatedScript`). It was carefully
//  quoted and well tested, but its shape meant the privileged side had to
//  trust whatever command the caller composed.
//
//  This contract inverts that. A request names an OPERATION and nothing else.
//  The argv is derived from the enum on the privileged side, so the set of
//  commands the helper can ever run is fixed at compile time and visible in
//  one switch statement. There is deliberately no field for a path, a flag, a
//  binary, or a command string — a client that is fully compromised still
//  cannot express "run this".
//
