//
//  MCP.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  Stdio MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. When Burrow is launched
//  with `--mcp`, the GUI path is skipped and this loop takes over,
//  reading JSON-RPC 2.0 messages from stdin and writing responses to
//  stdout (line-delimited).
//
//  This isn't a long-lived service — Claude Code spawns the binary on
//  demand and keeps it alive only while the conversation is live. Each
//  spawn opens its own SQLite handle into the same `burrow.db` the GUI
//  app writes to. SQLite WAL means the spawn can read concurrently
//  with the GUI's sampler write loop.
//
//  The server speaks the 2026-07-28 revision — the one that retired the
//  `initialize` handshake in favour of per-request `_meta` — while still
//  answering a pre-2026 client that expects the handshake. The envelope
//  layer lives in MCPProtocol.swift; the routing lives in MCPServer.swift;
//  this file keeps the process entry point and the tool catalogue.
//
//  Protocol surface implemented:
//    * server/discover → supported versions, capabilities, instructions
//    * initialize / notifications/initialized → legacy handshake, still served
//    * tools/list, tools/call → the catalogue below, with MRTR and tasks
//    * resources/list, resources/templates/list, resources/read
//    * prompts/list, prompts/get, completion/complete
//    * tasks/get, tasks/update, tasks/cancel (io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks)
//
//  All other methods return JSON-RPC error -32601 (method not found).
//  Tool results are wrapped as `{content: [{type: "text", text: "..."}]}`
//  per MCP convention — the text payload is the actual JSON we want
//  the agent to read, mirrored into `structuredContent` for the tools
//  that declare an output schema.
//
//  Wire it up in your Claude Code config (`~/.claude/settings.json`):
