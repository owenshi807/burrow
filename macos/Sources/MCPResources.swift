//
//  MCPResources.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  Resources, resource templates, prompts, and argument completion.
//
//  Burrow is a data-rich app that, until now, exposed all of it through
//  tool calls only. Resources fit the read-mostly half of that data better:
//  an agent can attach `burrow://doctor` to its context once instead of
//  re-calling a tool, and the `ttlMs` hints tell it how long the attachment
//  stays honest — five seconds for a live snapshot, a minute for a digest.
//
//  Everything here is read-only by construction. Resources map onto the
//  same read tools the catalogue already exposes, so there is exactly one
//  implementation of each answer; nothing that deletes is reachable from a
//  resource URI or a prompt.
//
