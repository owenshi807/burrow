//
//  MoActions.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  The gated-actions core (issue #51): the catalog of every destructive
//  `mo` action as DATA (argv / stdin / timeout / elevation / severity),
//  one pure gate shared by the GUI and the MCP server, and the owner of
//  the MCP action wire format.
//
//  The spine is the ticket-mint invariant: `MoActions.decide` is the ONLY
//  place a RunTicket can be constructed (file-private init), and runners
//  only accept tickets — so nothing in either process can execute a real
//  `mo` action without passing the same policy. "GUI ≡ MCP" is a property
//  of the code, not a discipline.
//
//  Deliberately pure: no Store, no Privacy, no AppKit — consent arrives
//  as data in the gate, verdicts come out. Which BINARY a ticket will be
//  spawned against arrives the same way, through `decide`'s `resolve` seam
//  (production default: `EngineTarget.resolve`), because the argv a ticket
//  carries is only correct relative to the program that will read it.
//
