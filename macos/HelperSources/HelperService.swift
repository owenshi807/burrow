//  The root daemon. This process runs as uid 0, so every line here is written
//  on the assumption that the thing talking to it is hostile until proven
//  otherwise.
//
//  ── The gauntlet a request runs ─────────────────────────────────────────
//  Five gates, in this order, each of which fails CLOSED:
//
//    1. Connection    the peer must satisfy the code requirement (Burrow,
//                     signed by our team), enforced by the SYSTEM via
//                     NSXPCListener.setConnectionCodeSigningRequirement
//                     before this process sees the connection at all.
//    2. Shape         the payload must decode as a `HelperRequest`. The
//                     operation is an enum, so an unknown verb dies here.
//    3. Freshness     the operation ID must be a UUID this daemon has never
//                     served. One authorization, one operation.
//    4. Authorization `AuthorizationCopyRights` must GRANT the right, which
//                     raises the system authentication prompt. This is the
//                     gate, not a GUI-side prompt.
//    5. Execution     argv is derived from the enum, and the executable is
//                     the signed engine inside our own bundle, verified
//                     before it is spawned.
//
//  Note what is absent: there is no path at which a caller-supplied string
//  becomes part of a command line. That is the property the whole design
//  exists to preserve.

/// plist. The plist route was tried first and was actively harmful: launchd
/// refused to exec the daemon at all, failing every spawn with EX_CONFIG, so
/// the attempt to gain observability destroyed the thing being observed — and
/// the symptom (a daemon that never runs and a 0-byte log) is indistinguishable
/// from a code-signing rejection.
///
/// Opening it in-process inverts that failure mode: a path the daemon cannot
/// write costs diagnostics, never the daemon.
