**Burrow puts everything your Mac needs in one free, native app: junk cleanup, dev-artifact purge, app uninstall with leftover removal, duplicate finding, safe maintenance, disk maps, and live system status — powered by a bundled, audited open-source engine ([burrow-engine](https://github.com/caezium/burrow-digger), a fork of [Mole](https://github.com/tw93/Mole)'s `mo`), so there's nothing else to install. And it does what no other cleaner does: it keeps months of local metric history and runs a built-in MCP server, so AI agents like Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor can watch, query, and care for your Mac — every action consent-gated, audited, and reversible. Native on macOS, with a Windows preview under [`windows/`](windows/).**

Mac:
```sh
brew install --cask caezium/tap/burrow
```

Windows: download from [releases](https://github.com/caezium/Burrow/releases)

## The tools

Burrow wraps a bundled, open-source Mole engine in a native desktop app: clean
junk, purge dev artifacts, sweep leftover installers, uninstall apps, run safe
maintenance, map your disk, and watch live system status — in one window. On top
of that it adds things the CLI doesn't have: a **long-running history** of your
machine's metrics in a local store and an **MCP server** so any AI agent (Claude
Code, Cursor, Codex…) can ask "what's been happening on this machine."

**macOS** is the mature flagship. **Windows** currently has a native WinUI 3 /
.NET 8 preview app, Windows telemetry/history, tray HUD, loopback HTTP, MCP
stdio bridge, CI, tests, and unsigned release packaging.


| Tool | What it does | `mo` command |
|---|---|---|
| **Status** | Live dashboard with per-metric sparklines and a sortable/pinnable process table. | `mo status --json` |
| **Clean** | Preview what's reclaimable, then clean for real — categorized cache/log/leftover removal. | `mo clean` |
| **Purge** | Reclaim space from dev projects: `node_modules`, build dirs, `target/`, `__pycache__`, and more. | `mo purge` |
| **Installers** | Find and remove leftover `.dmg`/`.pkg` installer files in bulk. | `mo installer` |
| **Optimize** | One-tap safe maintenance: rebuild caches, repair metadata, flush DNS, restart Dock/Finder. | `mo optimize` |
| **Software** | Installed-app list with search/sort (size, name, recent, source) and multi-select uninstall; a Homebrew **Updates** tab. | `mo uninstall --list`, `brew outdated` |
| **Analyze** | Squarified treemap of your disk; drill into any folder, reveal in Finder. | `mo analyze --json` |

Every scan offers a **no-risk preview** (`--dry-run`) first, a clear
**reclaimed-space summary** when it finishes, and a **Stop** button to abort a
running job.

### What's on the Status dashboard

A live, glanceable read of your Mac's vitals, refreshed continuously:

- **CPU** — usage, load averages (1/5/15), core count, temperature
- **Memory** — used %, pressure (normal/warning/critical), swap
- **GPU** — name and utilisation (Apple Silicon via IOAccelerator)
- **Disk** — capacity and live read/write I/O rates
- **Network** — up/down throughput per interface
- **Battery** — percentage, health, cycle count, time remaining
- **Health score** — Mole's overall 0–100 rating, with a one-line reason
- **Top processes** — by CPU or memory, sortable and pinnable

### Burrow's own extras

- **History** — long-range charts (5 m → 90 d) over a local SQLite history of
  every metric, plus peak-per-process tables. Nothing the CLI keeps.
- **Activity** — a running log of what Burrow has done (cleans, optimizes,
  scans) and the live status of anything in flight.
- **Menu-bar HUD** — health hero, metric tiles, top processes, and live job
  status, all from the menu bar (you can also run as a Dock app instead).
- **MCP server** — a stdio JSON-RPC server (`burrow mcp` / `Burrow --mcp`) plus
  an optional localhost HTTP API, so any AI agent can query your Mac's recent
  state. See [Use it with your AI agent](#use-it-with-your-ai-agent).
- **Signed native updates** — Sparkle checks a signed feed and presents its
  native update UI; archives and the feed are both Ed25519-signed, and nothing
  downloads or installs automatically. A real 0.11.0-to-0.11.1 update completed
  without Terminal or Homebrew and relaunched the notarized app successfully.

## Platforms

| | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Status | **Stable** — flagship | **Preview** — checked in under `windows/` |
| Engine | bundled MIT engine (a fork of `mo`, Go CLI); falls back to a system `mo` | bundled Mole/PowerShell engine plus Windows fallbacks where needed |
| UI | SwiftUI, translucent menu-bar app | WinUI 3 / .NET 8 |
| Install | `brew install --cask caezium/tap/burrow` | build from source; unsigned preview artifacts via `windows/scripts/build-release.ps1` |
| Source | [`macos/`](macos/) | [`windows/`](windows/) |

Both apps live in this one repo, side by side, sharing this README, the landing
site, and release documentation. The Windows preview currently includes a native
shell, tool pages, local telemetry/history, loopback HTTP/MCP surfaces, tests,
CI, and unsigned local packaging. See the [Windows architecture notes](windows/docs/windows-architecture.md)
and [release notes](windows/docs/release.md).

### Windows preview

The checked-in Windows app currently includes:

- A native WinUI 3 / .NET 8 shell with Dashboard, History, Activity, Analyze,
  Clean, Purge, Installers, Apps, Optimize, and Settings routes.
- Local Windows telemetry sampling for Dashboard, History, tray status, HTTP,
  and MCP.
- Local JSONL-backed history/activity storage.
- Optimize preview/confirm flows through Mole where available; the Windows Clean
  route is present but still a guarded pending stub until Mole Windows exposes a
  stable non-interactive cleanup contract for the GUI.
- Native Windows fallback flows for Analyze, Purge, installer cleanup, and app
  inventory where the Windows Mole branch is still interactive or lacks JSON.
- A tray icon, live tooltip, tray HUD, status menu, and quick navigation.
- A loopback-only HTTP API (`/health`, `/info`, `/snapshot`, `/metrics`) and a
  stdio MCP bridge with the read-only Burrow tools.
- Unit tests, Windows CI, local smoke-test helpers, and an unsigned release
  script that produces a setup executable, portable ZIP, hashes, and WinGet
  manifests.

## Roadmap

<!-- ROADMAP:BEGIN generated by scripts/site-release.py; edit docs/roadmap.json instead -->
The full board, with status and voting, lives at **[burrow.computer/roadmap](https://burrow.computer/roadmap)**. Vote by upvoting an issue, or [open a request](https://github.com/caezium/Burrow/issues/new/choose).

**Building**

- A single interface for machine care and agent work, Burrow grew tool by tool. The next pass designs it as one product: one navigation model, one task hierarchy, and a clear place for the agent surfaces that arrived late.

**Planned**

- Windows preview → first stable, Data-loss and supply-chain hardening, parity, and test coverage before it loses the “preview” label. ([#93](https://github.com/caezium/Burrow/issues/93))
- Uninstall that never quietly does nothing, A handful of Homebrew apps use a cask token that differs from the display name, so a name-based lookup resolves most apps and misses the exceptions. Uninstall gets exact resolution and a visible result either way.

**Considering**

- Persistent one-tap “run all” Tune-Up, A saved Smart-Care routine you trigger in one tap from the dashboard. ([#77](https://github.com/caezium/Burrow/issues/77))
- Faster, deeper Analyze, Better navigation through very large trees, quicker re-render on drill-down, and caching so a second scan of the same volume is close to instant.

_Recently shipped: Developer ID signed & Apple-notarized macOS releases, Signed Sparkle feed + updater foundation, Stable Full Disk Access identity across updates, Bundled MIT engine, no separate `mo` install, Process inspector + CPU watchdog, see the [changelog](https://burrow.computer/releases.html)._

## How Burrow compares to other tools

A factual feature/scope comparison. The competitor columns are the **macOS**
landscape; the Windows column reflects only the checked-in preview.
**mole.fit** is from the original author of `mo` — buy it ($19) if you want that
and to fund `mo`.

|  | Burrow (macOS) | Burrow (Windows preview) | mole.fit | CleanMyMac | Pearcleaner | `mo` / ncdu |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Price | Free | Free | $19 once | Subscription | Free | Free |
| Open source | MIT | MIT | – | – | ✅ | ✅ (`mo`) |
| Signed / notarized | ✅ Developer ID + Apple notarization *(0.11.0+; earlier archives lack both)* | No — unsigned preview | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | n/a |
| Junk cleanup | ✅ | partial - Clean route pending | ✅ | ✅ | – | ✅ (`mo`) |
| Dev-artifact purge | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | partial | – | ✅ (`mo`) |
| Leftover-installer sweep | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | – | ✅ (`mo`) |
| Uninstall + leftovers | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ *(focus)* | ✅ (`mo`) |
| Disk treemap | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | – | ncdu *(TUI)* |
| Live system monitor | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | partial | – | – |
| Long-term metric history | ✅ | ✅ *(JSON)* | – | – | – | – |
| MCP / agent API | ✅ | ✅ | – | – | – | – |
| GUI | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | – *(terminal)* |

## Settings

Everything is local and takes effect immediately unless noted:

| Setting | What it controls |
|---|---|
| **History retention** | How long metric history is kept (1 day → 1 year); older rows are pruned hourly. |
| **Vacuum after large prunes** | Reclaim DB file space after a big prune (off by default). |
| **Sampling rate** | How often Burrow runs `mo status --json` (5 s → 5 min). |
| **App language** | Follow the system, or force English / 简体中文 / 繁體中文 / Русский *(relaunch)*. |
| **Menu-bar icon** | Show the menu-bar item, or run as a regular Dock app instead. |
| **MCP / agent access** | Copyable stdio config + the tool list for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Cline, and any MCP client. |
| **Local HTTP query server** | Optional loopback REST endpoints + port for dashboards/curl. On Windows, disabling this keeps the local `/mcp` bridge available for stdio MCP. |
| **Mole engine** | Shows the active engine version. The bundled engine updates with signed Burrow releases; source builds using an external engine retain its updater. |

## Permissions & Full Disk Access

Cleaning system and app caches means reading TCC-protected folders, so macOS
will prompt — once per folder — unless the app has **Full Disk Access**. Burrow
handles this honestly:

- Before a flood-prone scan it shows a gate explaining the trade-off, with a
  one-click link to **System Settings → Full Disk Access** (grant once, no more
  prompts).
- Don't want to grant it? **Scan with admin** runs the same scan as root —
  root bypasses TCC, so it's a single password prompt instead of a flood.
- Burrow only ever reads sizes; it never opens that data itself, and the real
  cleanup always goes through macOS's own admin dialog.

## Requirements

### macOS

- **macOS 14+**
- **No separate engine install.** Burrow bundles its own MIT engine
  (`burrow-engine`) and runs it directly. _(Building from source? The engine is
  staged from a git submodule; if it isn't present, Burrow falls back to a
  system `mo` — `brew install mole`.)_

### Windows preview

- **Windows 10/11**
- **.NET 8 SDK** for local build/test.
- **Inno Setup** only when running the unsigned release packaging script.

## Install

> Burrow 0.11.0 is the first Developer ID-signed and Apple-notarized release.
> New official macOS tags must pass signing, notarization, ticket stapling, and
> Gatekeeper assessment before they can publish. Version 0.10.5 used an ad-hoc
> signature rather than Developer ID and was not notarized; older archives also
> predate the current distribution guarantee.
> The full security/trust write-up is in **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install --cask caezium/tap/burrow   # the app + bundled engine
```

The live cask installs the signed and notarized build, preserves quarantine so
Gatekeeper can validate Apple's ticket, and contains no `postflight` bypass or
unsigned-build warning. It is marked `auto_updates true` because Sparkle owns
in-app updates.

### Direct download

Download `Burrow-x.y.z.zip` from
[Releases](https://github.com/caezium/Burrow/releases), unzip into
`/Applications`, then:

```bash
open /Applications/Burrow.app
```

Keep the downloaded app's quarantine metadata intact: Gatekeeper uses it to
verify the stapled notarization ticket. If you're intentionally installing an
archived 0.10.5-or-earlier build, right-click the app and choose **Open**;
those builds predate the notarization ticket.

### macOS build from source

```bash
brew install xcodegen
git clone https://github.com/caezium/Burrow.git && cd Burrow
bash scripts/release.sh
cp -R build_dist/Build/Products/Release/Burrow.app /Applications/
open /Applications/Burrow.app
```

The local script applies a coherent ad-hoc signature to the app and every
bundled executable so Full Disk Access works during development. Only official
tag builds use the private Developer ID identity and Apple notarization.

Burrow lives in the menu bar (it's a menu-bar agent). Click the icon → **Open
Burrow** — or turn the menu-bar icon off in Settings to run it as a Dock app.
If a macOS build freezes while Burrow creates that status item, the next launch
stays in Dock-based compatibility mode on the same OS build and offers a
one-click redacted diagnostic report. Automatic Sparkle startup waits until
the initial AppKit launch turn has settled and the status item is stable; if
the updater then fails its own stability window,
later automatic checks pause for that app/OS build while manual checks remain
available. A new macOS build retries a guarded status item; a new Burrow or
macOS build retries an updater that previously failed its stability window.

### Windows preview build

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/caezium/Burrow.git
cd Burrow\windows
dotnet restore .\BurrowWin.sln
dotnet build .\BurrowWin.csproj -c Release -p:Platform=x64 -nr:false -v:minimal
dotnet test .\Tests\BurrowWin.Tests\BurrowWin.Tests.csproj -c Release -v:minimal
```

To create the checked-in unsigned preview artifacts locally:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-release.ps1
```

That script builds the app, runs tests, publishes the WinUI payload, creates an
unsigned Inno Setup installer, creates a portable ZIP fallback, writes
`SHA256SUMS.txt`, and writes WinGet manifests. See
[`windows/docs/release.md`](windows/docs/release.md).

## Security & trust

Burrow drives a bundled, open-source Mole engine (an MIT fork of `mo`). The honest privacy picture:

- **No accounts, no ads.** Your metrics, history, and file contents stay on
  your machine. The macOS app sends opt-out anonymous usage plus crash, hang,
  startup, update, and sampled performance diagnostics. It sends no screen
  recordings, user files, user paths, metrics, or stored IP; turn it off in
  Settings. PostHog delivery and its bounded sanitized retry outbox run entirely
  off AppKit's main thread. Full list in **[TELEMETRY.md](TELEMETRY.md)**.
- **No background root helper by default.** When Clean/Optimize need admin
  rights, macOS's own dialog asks you and Burrow runs that one `mo` command,
  then exits — you approve every elevation. You can opt in to a small signed
  helper so those prompts accept Touch ID; it grants no standing privilege
  (every root operation still authenticates, every time), performs only scan,
  clean, and optimize, and can be removed from Settings. Details in
  **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.
- **Local-only surfaces:** the MCP/HTTP surfaces bind to loopback only
  (`127.0.0.1`) and history is stored locally. On Windows, the HTTP REST toggle
  disables REST endpoints but keeps the local `/mcp` bridge route available for
  stdio MCP clients. The macOS Updates tab runs `brew outdated`, the same check
  `brew` does for itself.
- **Distribution signatures:** new official macOS tags fail unless Developer ID
  signing, notarization, and the signed Sparkle ZIP/feed checks pass; local
  macOS builds use an ad-hoc development identity. Windows preview artifacts
  remain unsigned, so direct-download users should expect SmartScreen or
  stricter Application Control policy prompts.
- The full honest write-up, including macOS admin trade-offs and the "Scan with
  admin" option, is in **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

## Use it with your AI agent

Burrow doubles as an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server over stdio,
so **any MCP-capable agent** — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Cline, Zed, and
others — can read your machine's recent state. Same server, same `{command, args}`
shape everywhere.

### Let your agent set it up

For macOS, paste this to your coding agent and it'll wire itself in:

> Add the **Burrow** MCP server to my config so you can read my Mac's system
> history. It's a local stdio MCP server — run it as `burrow mcp` if the
> Homebrew shim is on my PATH, otherwise
> `/Applications/Burrow.app/Contents/MacOS/Burrow` with args `["--mcp"]`. Add it
> under my MCP servers, reload, and confirm the tools `burrow_snapshot`,
> `burrow_history`, `burrow_top_processes`, `burrow_process_usage`, and
> `burrow_info` are available. Then tell me my Mac's current CPU and memory.

### Or configure it manually

The config is the same JSON for every agent — only the file differs:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "burrow": {
      "command": "/Applications/Burrow.app/Contents/MacOS/Burrow",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

| Agent | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/settings.json` — or `claude mcp add burrow -- /Applications/Burrow.app/Contents/MacOS/Burrow --mcp` |
| **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (per project) |
| **Codex** | add a `[mcp_servers.burrow]` entry in `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| **Cline / Zed / other** | the client's "MCP servers" / `mcpServers` config |

If you installed via Homebrew, a `burrow` shim is on your PATH, so you can use
`command: "burrow", args: ["mcp"]` instead of the bundle path. Reload the agent
and ask in plain language.

Windows preview builds include the stdio bridge in source under
`windows/Tools/McpStdioBridge/` and in release artifacts as
`Assets\Mcp\burrow-mcp-stdio.exe`.

**Tools** — exposed over MCP and read-only by default. The full reference, with **when an
agent should reach for each**, is in **[docs/agent-tools.md](docs/agent-tools.md)**.
The essentials:

- **Status & history** — `burrow_snapshot`, `burrow_history`, `burrow_top_processes`,
  `burrow_process_usage` (rank by `cpu_time`/`peak_cpu`/`avg_cpu`/`peak_mem`),
  `burrow_diff`, `burrow_disk_forecast`, `burrow_report`
- **Diagnose** — `burrow_doctor` (Full Disk Access, memory pressure, disk headroom,
  SIP/Gatekeeper/FileVault/firewall, battery, high-CPU, display/volume/network),
  `burrow_ports`, `burrow_info`
- **Disk & apps** — `burrow_analyze`, `burrow_list_apps`, `burrow_cleanup_history`,
  `burrow_deleted_files`, `burrow_cleanup_runs`
- **Exact Agent cleanup** — `burrow_stage_cleanup_plan` freezes typed candidate IDs;
  `burrow_execute_cleanup_plan` revalidates and moves only Burrow-approved IDs to Trash
- **Maintain (gated)** — `burrow_clean` (legacy preview), `burrow_optimize`, `burrow_uninstall`,
  `burrow_purge`, `burrow_installer`

Agent cleanup is a two-step capability: stage a plan, inspect its typed meaning, then
execute exact candidate IDs with `confirm:true` and the matching Settings opt-in.
Burrow rechecks identity and subtree changes at execution, skips drifted items, moves
the stable subset to Trash, and records a per-item receipt. The legacy `burrow_clean`
can still preview but no longer accepts broad Agent execution.

Windows also keeps `burrow_uninstall(action=...)` as a compatibility tool for
list, leftover-preview, and confirmed vendor-uninstaller launch workflows.

There's also an optional localhost REST API (`127.0.0.1:9277` — `/health`,
`/info`, `/snapshot`, `/metrics`) for dashboards or curl. Loopback is a network
boundary, not authentication: every request needs the random per-install bearer
credential, an exact localhost `Host`, no browser `Origin`, and stays inside the
request-size/rate limits. On macOS, read the credential locally with
`defaults read dev.caezium.Burrow query_auth_token`; on Windows it lives in the
current user's `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BurrowWin\settings.json`, and the stdio bridge
adds it automatically. Disabling Windows REST does not close the listener
because the authenticated stdio bridge still posts to `/mcp`.

```bash
BURROW_HTTP_TOKEN="$(defaults read dev.caezium.Burrow query_auth_token)"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BURROW_HTTP_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:9277/health
```

## Develop & test

### macOS

```bash
cd macos        # the macOS app lives here (monorepo: macos/ + windows/)
bash ../scripts/fetch-sentry.sh   # vendor Sentry.xcframework (it's a local framework, not an SPM dep)
bash ../scripts/fetch-sparkle.sh  # vendor the checksum-pinned official Sparkle.framework
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project Burrow.xcodeproj -scheme Burrow \
  -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

The suite covers the parts that matter through public interfaces: DB roundtrip
+ range + stride sampler + prune + corruption recovery, Store clamping/defaults,
Maintenance prune, MCP tool routing + the semantic usage ranking, squarified
treemap invariants, the Full Disk Access decision, and `mo` output parsing.

### Windows preview

```powershell
cd windows
dotnet restore .\BurrowWin.sln
dotnet build .\BurrowWin.csproj -c Release -p:Platform=x64 -nr:false -v:minimal
dotnet build .\Tests\BurrowWin.Tests\BurrowWin.Tests.csproj -c Release -nr:false -v:minimal
dotnet test .\Tests\BurrowWin.Tests\BurrowWin.Tests.csproj -c Release --no-build -v:minimal
```

For local GUI smoke checks:

```powershell
.\run-local.ps1 -NoBuild -SmokeTest -Restart -RequireHealth -Route settings -TimeoutSeconds 60
```

## Architecture

### macOS

```
mo status --json   ──>  Sampler ──> SQLite (WAL) ──┬─> Status / History (charts)
                                                   ├─> HTTP QueryServer (:9277)
                                                   └─> burrow mcp (stdio) ─> Claude Code / Cursor / Codex
mo analyze --json  ──>  DiskScanner + squarified Treemap ──────> Analyze
mo clean / purge / installer / optimize ─> CommandRunner (streamed) ─> the tool tabs
mo uninstall --list ─>  Software (+ brew outdated for Updates)
```

One binary, two modes: default is the menu-bar GUI; `burrow mcp` (or `Burrow
--mcp`) is the stdio MCP server (it forks before SwiftUI claims the process).
The whole UI is one translucent window with a top-pill nav (`Brand`/`Tool`
design system); Settings, History, and Activity are panes in that same window.

### Windows preview

The Windows app is a WinUI 3 / .NET 8 project in [`windows/`](windows/) using
MVVM view models, service-layer Windows/Mole integration, local JSONL history,
loopback HTTP, and a stdio MCP bridge. Mole remains the preferred engine path
where it is safe and non-interactive; Windows-native fallbacks cover current
gaps in the Windows Mole branch. See
[`windows/docs/windows-architecture.md`](windows/docs/windows-architecture.md).

## Contributing

Burrow is community-driven. The repo currently contains the macOS app in
[`macos/`](macos/) and the Windows preview in [`windows/`](windows/). We welcome
bug fixes, tests, documentation improvements, and focused improvements to the
checked-in platform implementations.
